### **Rules During Gameplay**

1. **Consent and Safety**:
   - **Consent is non-negotiable**. All participants must agree to the tasks before proceeding.
   - If any player feels uncomfortable or needs to pause, they can use the **safe word**.
   - If a player skips a task using the safe word, they do not lose points, but they do not earn points for that round either.
   
2. **Performing Tasks**:
   - Players must **complete the task as described** on the card to earn full points. Other players can judge and vote whether the task was performed to satisfaction.
   - The group can decide if a player earns full points, partial points, or no points based on how well they complete the task.
   
3. **Voting**:
   - After each task is performed, the group can vote on whether the task was completed effectively, based on the eroticism and performance of the player. The voting is typically informal, with a majority agreement determining the point award.
   - If the group believes the task was fully completed with confidence and eroticism, the player earns **full points**.
   - If the performance was less convincing or incomplete, the player may earn **partial points**.

4. **Time Limits**:
   - For tasks requiring time limits (e.g., edging, teasing, or timed dares), use a timer to enforce the limit.
   - If the player successfully completes the task within the time limit, they earn the points indicated on the card.

### **Earning Points**

- **Partial Completion**:  
  If a player hesitates or does not fully commit to the task, the group can agree to give them **partial points** (half of the full points).

- **Skipping a Task**:  
  If a player chooses to skip a task using the safe word, they do not earn any points for that turn but will not lose any previously earned points either.
